# Word_Cloud_Shiny_App

## 3 reasons you should use word clouds to present your text data
#### Word clouds add simplicity and clarity. The most frequently used words stand out better in a word cloud than in other representations
#### Word clouds are a potent communication tool. They are easy to understand, easy to share, and are an easy way to create impact
#### Word clouds are more visually engaging than a table data

## Who is using word clouds ?
#### Researchers : for reporting qualitative data
#### Marketers : for highlighting the needs and pain points of customers
#### Educators : to support essential issues
#### Politicians and journalists
#### social media sites : to collect, analyze and share user sentiments

#### This app will allow you to load a .txt or .csv file from your local harddrive to be mined and represented as a wordcloud.

#### I have supplied a sample .csv file titled "fifa_5000.csv" that can be downloaded. This .csv file contains 5000 tweets created during the 2018 FIFA WorldCup. This is a subset of the original .csv fileile from original 530000 tweets.

#### To run this app locally, you will need to download the "ui.r" and "server.r" to your compute. The "fifa_5000.csv" file can also be downloaded and used as the text file for upload to the shiny app.


#### Due to the limited space shinyapps.io has per instance, the app will only read 2000 lines.
